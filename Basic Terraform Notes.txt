Terraform basics:

Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Here’s a list of key topics and concepts related to Terraform:

1. **Introduction to Terraform**
   - What is Terraform?
		Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative way, using a human-readable configuration language called HCL 
		
   - Benefits of using Terraform
		Efficiency and Automation
		Scalability and Flexibility
		Collaboration and Version Control
		Cost Optimization
		Improved Reliability and Security

2. **Installation and Setup**
   - Installing Terraform
		download binary
		add it to environment variables
		
   - Configuring your environment
		1. Install terraform
		2. install azure cli and login with az login
		3. Create directory
		4. initialize terraform with terraform init
		5. Create main.tf file in working directory
			terraform {
              required_providers {
                azurerm = {
                  source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
                  version = "~> 3.0"
                }
              }
            }

            provider "azurerm" {
              features {}
            }


3. **Basic Concepts**
   - Providers
		Providers are the essential components that enable Terraform to interact with different infrastructure platforms. They act as plugins that offer a set of resources and data sources to manage various cloud providers, on-premises systems, and other services
		
   - Resources
		Resources are the core components of a Terraform configuration. They represent the desired state of infrastructure objects that you want to manage. This could be anything from virtual machines and networks to storage volumes and DNS records.
		
   - Data sources
		Data sources in Terraform are used to retrieve information about existing resources or external systems. Unlike resources which create or modify infrastructure, data sources only fetch data.
		
   - Modules
		Modules in Terraform are containers for multiple resources that work together to achieve a specific goal. They promote code reusability, organization, and maintainability
		
   - State management
		Terraform state is a critical component that tracks the resources managed by your configuration. It stores information about the resources' IDs, attributes, and dependencies. This information is essential for Terraform to understand the current state of your infrastructure and determine the necessary actions to achieve the desired state.
		
   - Variables and outputs
		Variables in Terraform allow you to parameterize your configuration, making it more flexible and reusable. They are placeholders for values that can be defined externally or within the configuration itself.
		
		Outputs are used to expose information about your infrastructure to the user or to other parts of your configuration. They can be used to display values, pass information to other modules, or use them in scripts.

4. **Terraform Workflow**
   - Writing configuration files
		A Terraform configuration file is a plain text file with a .tf extension. It defines the desired state of your infrastructure using the HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax.
		
			provider "azurerm" {
              features {}
            }

            resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
              name     = "example-resource-group"
              location = "West US"
            }

            resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
              name                = "example-vnet"
              address_space      = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
              location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
              resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
            }
			
		Explanation:
			Provider Block: Defines the Azure provider and enables certain features.
            Resource Group: Creates a resource group to hold resources.
            Virtual Network: Creates a virtual network within the resource group.

		
   - Initializing a configuration
		Terraform init is the command used to initialize a Terraform working directory. It performs several crucial tasks:
			Downloads required plugins: Installs necessary provider plugins based on your configuration.   
            Initializes the backend: Sets up the backend configuration if specified.   
            Creates a lock file: Prevents concurrent Terraform operations.   

   - Planning changes
		Terraform plan is the cornerstone for previewing changes before applying them to your infrastructure. It generates an execution plan, outlining the actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state.
		How it works:
			Reads the current state: Terraform fetches the latest state of your infrastructure from the configured backend.
            Compares configuration and state: It compares your Terraform configuration with the current state of your resources.
            Generates an execution plan: Based on the differences, Terraform creates a detailed plan of actions to be performed.
		The output of terraform plan will show you:
            Resources to be created: New resources that will be added.
            Resources to be modified: Existing resources that will be changed.
            Resources to be destroyed: Resources that will be removed.

   - Applying changes
		Terraform apply is the command that brings your desired infrastructure state to life. It takes the execution plan generated by terraform plan and executes the necessary actions.
		Important Consideration:
			Review the plan: Always review the output of terraform plan before applying changes.
            Confirmation: Terraform will prompt you for confirmation before making changes.
            State Management: Ensure your state file is up-to-date and accessible.
            Error Handling: Be prepared to handle potential errors and rollbacks.
			
   - Destroying infrastructure
		The terraform destroy command is used to terminate resources managed by your Terraform project. It's essentially the inverse of terraform apply.
		terraform destroy
			This will generate an execution plan outlining the resources to be destroyed. You'll be prompted to confirm the destruction before proceeding.
		To destroy a specific resource:
			terraform destroy -target=aws_instance.web_server

5. **Terraform Configuration Language**
   - HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
		HCL is the configuration language used by Terraform and other HashiCorp tools. It's designed to be human-readable and machine-parseable, making it a suitable choice for infrastructure as code.
		
   - Syntax and structure
		A HCL configuration file consists of one or more blocks. A block is defined by a name followed by a pair of curly braces. Within the block, you can define attributes using key-value pairs.
			resource "aws_instance" "example" {
              ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
              instance_type = "t2.micro"
              tags = {
                Name = "example-instance"
              }
            }
		Key Component:
			Blocks: Define the type of resource or configuration element.
            Arguments: Key-value pairs within a block, specifying attributes and values.
            Expressions: Dynamic values using interpolation or functions.
            Comments: Explanatory text using #.
            Lists: Collections of values enclosed in square brackets.
            Objects: Key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces.

		
   - Using comments and formatting
		Comments in HCL are essential for improving code readability and maintainability. They help explain the logic behind code, document decisions, and provide context for future modifications
		# This is a single-line comment
		
		Consistent formatting is crucial for making HCL code easier to read and understand. While HCL doesn't enforce strict formatting rules, following common coding conventions improves code maintainability.

6. **Providers**
   - Overview of providers
		Providers are the essential components that enable Terraform to interact with different infrastructure platforms. They act as plugins that offer a set of resources and data sources to manage various cloud providers, on-premises systems, and other services.
		
   - Commonly used providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)
   
   - Managing provider plugins
		Terraform relies on plugins, known as providers, to interact with various cloud platforms, infrastructure management tools, and other services. Effectively managing these providers is crucial for smooth Terraform operations.
		Understanding provider plugin:
			Purpose: Providers offer resource types and data sources to manage infrastructure.   
            Location: They are installed in Terraform's plugin directory.
            Versioning: Providers have versions, and it's essential to manage them to avoid compatibility issues

7. **Resources and Data Sources**
   - Defining resources
		Resources are the core building blocks of a Terraform configuration. They represent the desired state of infrastructure objects that you want to manage. This could be anything from virtual machines and networks to storage volumes and DNS records.
		How resource works:
			Resource Blocks: These define the configuration for a specific resource.
            Resource Type: Specifies the type of resource (e.g., aws_instance, azurerm_virtual_network).
            Resource Name: A unique identifier within the module.
            Arguments: Define the desired state of the resource (e.g., instance type, subnet CIDR).
		resource "aws_instance" "web" {
          ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
          instance_type = "t2.micro"

          tags = {
            Name = "web-server"
          }
        }
		In this example:
			aws_instance is the resource type.
            web is the resource name.
            ami, instance_type, and tags are arguments defining the instance.
	
   - Using data sources
		Data sources in Terraform are used to retrieve information about existing resources or external systems. Unlike resources which create or modify infrastructure, data sources only fetch data.
		How Data Source Works:
			Define the data source: Specify the type of data you want to retrieve and any necessary filters.
            Retrieve data: Terraform queries the specified source and populates the data source with attributes.
            Use the data: Reference the data source attributes in other parts of your configuration.
		data "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
          name = "example-resource-group"
        }
        output "resource_group_location" {
          value = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.location
        }
		In this example,
			We define a data source azurerm_resource_group to fetch information about the resource group named example-resource-group.
            The location attribute of the resource group is then exported as an output.
		Common use cases:
			Fetching existing resource information: Retrieve details about resources created outside Terraform.
            Dynamic configuration: Use data source values to construct dynamic resource configurations.
            Referencing external data: Incorporate data from other systems into your Terraform configuration.
	
   - Resource dependencies
		Terraform automatically infers dependencies between resources based on references within the configuration. However, in some cases, explicit dependencies might be required.
		Implicit Dependencies:
			Terraform automatically detects dependencies when a resource references another resource's attributes.
			resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
              name     = "example-rg"
              location = "West US"
            }
            resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
              name                = "example-vnet"
              address_space      = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
              location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
              resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
            }
			In this example, the azurerm_virtual_network resource depends on the azurerm_resource_group because it references the resource group's location and name. Terraform will automatically create the resource group before creating the virtual network.
		Explicit Dependencies:
			The depends_on meta-argument can be used to specify explicit dependencies between resources.
			resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
               name     = "example-rg"
               location = "West US"
            }
            resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
              name                = "example-vnet"
              address_space      = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
              location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
              resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
              depends_on = [azurerm_resource_group.example]
            }
			In this example, the depends_on argument explicitly states that the virtual network depends on the resource group.
			When to Use depends_on
				When there's a dependency that Terraform cannot infer automatically.
                When you want to ensure a specific order of resource creation.
                When dealing with complex resource relationships.


8. **Variables and Outputs**
   - Defining variables
		Terraform variables are placeholders for values that can be used to make your configurations more dynamic and reusable. They allow you to define values that can be reused throughout your Terraform configuration, similar to variables in any programming language
		Declaring a Variable:
			Variables are defined within a variable block. You can specify the type, description, and default value of the variable.
			variable "instance_type" {
              type        = string
              description = "EC2 instance type"
              default     = "t2.micro"
            }
			There are multiple ways to assign values to variables:
              Directly in the configuration: This is useful for testing or quick configurations.
              Command-line flags: Use the -var or -var-file flags when running terraform apply.
              Environment variables: Set environment variables with the same name as the variable.
              Terraform Cloud/Enterprise: Use the UI or API to set variable values.

   - Input and output variables
		Input variables in Terraform are like parameters passed to a function. They allow you to customize the behavior of a module or configuration without modifying the source code.
		variable "location" {
          type        = string
          description = "Azure location"
        }
        variable "resource_group_name" {
          type        = string
          description = "Azure resource group name"
        }
		
		Output variables expose information from your Terraform configuration. They can be used to share values with other parts of your infrastructure or for displaying information to the user.
		resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
          name                = "example-vnet"
          address_space      = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
          location            = var.location
          resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
        }
        output "vnet_id" {
          value = azurerm_virtual_network.example.id
        }
		Using Imput and Output Variable
			Passing Values to Modules: Input variables can be used to pass values to modules.
			Sharing Information Between Resources: Output variables can be used to share information between resources within the same configuration.
			Accessing Values Externally: Output variables can be used to access information about your infrastructure from outside Terraform.

   - Sensitive variables
		Sensitive variables are those that contain confidential information like API keys, passwords, or access tokens. Terraform provides a way to protect this sensitive data by marking variables as sensitive.
		variable "storage_account_key" {
          type        = string
          sensitive   = true
          description = "Storage account key"
        }
		Using sensative variable:
		  You can use sensitive variables like any other variable in your configuration:
		  resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
            name                = "mystorageaccount"
            resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
            account_replication_type = "GRS"
            primary_access_key = var.storage_account_key
          }
		Important Consideration:
			Security: Sensitive variables should be handled with care. Avoid committing them directly to version control.
            Masking: Terraform will mask the value of sensitive variables when displayed.
            Environment Variables: Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.
            Terraform Cloud/Enterprise: Leverage features like secret management for storing sensitive data.

9. **State Management**
   - Understanding state
		Terraform state is a critical component that tracks the resources managed by your configuration. It stores information about the resources' IDs, attributes, and dependencies. This information is essential for Terraform to understand the current state of your infrastructure and determine the necessary actions to achieve the desired state.
		
   - Storing state locally vs. remotely
		Local state is stored in a file named terraform.tfstate within your Terraform working directory. This is suitable for small, isolated environments or testing purposes.
		For larger projects, collaboration, and increased security, storing state remotely is recommended. Terraform supports various backend options, including: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
		Configuration:
			terraform {
              backend "azurerm" {
                storage_account_name = "yourstorageaccountname"
                container_name       = "terraformstate"
                key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
              }
			}
		Choosing Between Local and Remote State
           Local state: Suitable for small, isolated environments or testing.
           Remote state: Recommended for production environments, collaboration, and security.	

   - State locking and consistency
		State locking is a crucial mechanism in Terraform to prevent concurrent modifications to the state file. This ensures data integrity and avoids conflicts when multiple users or processes are working on the same infrastructure.
		How it works:
			When a Terraform operation starts, it acquires a lock on the state file.
			While the lock is held, other Terraform processes cannot modify the state file.
			Once the operation completes, the lock is released.
		
		Consistency in Terraform ensures that the state file accurately reflects the actual infrastructure. This is essential for correct planning and execution of Terraform operations

10. **Modules**
		Modules in Terraform are containers for multiple resources that work together to achieve a specific goal. They promote code reusability, organization, and maintainability.
		A module is typically a directory containing one or more .tf files. These files define the resources, data sources, outputs, and variables for the module.
		
    - Creating and using modules
	
    - Module composition
		A Terraform module is essentially a self-contained unit of infrastructure configuration. It's composed of the following elements:
		Core Component:
			Resources: These define the infrastructure objects to be managed within the module. Examples include EC2 instances, Azure virtual machines, S3 buckets, etc.
            Data Sources: Used to fetch information about existing resources or external systems.
            Variables: Allow customization of the module's behavior by accepting input values.
            Outputs: Export values from the module for use in other parts of the configuration.
            Providers: While not strictly part of the module structure, providers are often used within modules to interact with specific platforms.
		Example of Module Structure:
			main.tf: Defines the core resources for the web server (e.g., EC2 instance, security group, load balancer).
            variables.tf: Defines input variables for the module (e.g., instance type, AMI, number of instances).
            outputs.tf: Defines output values from the module (e.g., public IP, load balancer DNS name).
			
    - Module versioning
		Module versioning is essential for managing the evolution of your Terraform modules and ensuring compatibility between different parts of your infrastructure. It allows you to control which version of a module is used in your configuration, preventing unexpected changes due to module updates.
		Version Constrain:
			Terraform supports version constraints when using modules from a module registry. This allows you to specify the acceptable versions of a module. 
				module "web_server" {
                  source = "terraform-aws-modules/web/aws"
                  version = "~> 3.0"
                }


11. **Workspaces**
		Terraform workspaces allow you to manage multiple independent sets of infrastructure using the same configuration. Each workspace has its own state file, enabling you to isolate different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or configurations within a single Terraform directory.
    - Using workspaces for environments
    - Managing multiple workspaces

12. **Provisioners**
		Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or commands on a local or remote machine after a resource is created or destroyed. They are often used for tasks that cannot be directly modeled using Terraform's declarative syntax.
		
    - Using provisioners to execute scripts
		Using remote-exec Provisioner
			The remote-exec provisioner is used to execute commands or scripts on a remote resource, such as an EC2 instance.
			resource "aws_instance" "example" {
            # ... instance configuration
			  provisioner "remote-exec" {
				inline = [
				  "sudo yum update -y",
				  "sudo yum install httpd -y",
				  "sudo systemctl start httpd",
				  "sudo systemctl enable httpd"
				]
			  }
			}
			In this example, the provisioner will run the specified commands on the newly created EC2 instance after it's created.

    - When to use provisioners
		Post-creation actions: When you need to perform actions on a resource immediately after its creation, such as installing software, configuring services, or setting up initial data.
		Tasks outside Terraform's core capabilities: For actions that are difficult or impossible to model declaratively within Terraform, such as running interactive scripts or using third-party tools.
		One-time setup: When you need to perform actions only once after a resource is created, such as generating SSH keys or configuring firewall rules.

Guide me step by step how can i create a linux virtual machine using terraform in azure portal with storage account, storage container and storage blob so that we can save the tfstate file securely i am using already existing resource group, so guide accordingly

Creating a Linux virtual machine using Terraform in Azure while securely storing the Terraform state file in a storage account involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this, assuming you have an existing resource group.

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Account:** Ensure you have an active Azure account.
2. **Terraform Installed:** Make sure Terraform is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
3. **Azure CLI Installed:** Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed. You can download it from the [Azure CLI website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
4. **Azure Subscription:** You need an active Azure subscription.
5. **Existing Resource Group:** You need an existing resource group in which you want to create the resources.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Configure Azure CLI

Log in to your Azure account using the Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
```

Set the subscription you want to use:

```bash
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-name-or-id"
```

#### Step 2: Create a Storage Account and Blob Container for Terraform State

1. **Create a Storage Account:**

   Use the Azure CLI to create a storage account in your existing resource group. Make sure the storage account name is globally unique.

   ```bash
   az storage account create \
     --name yourstorageaccountname \
     --resource-group your-resource-group \
     --location your-location \
     --sku Standard_LRS
   ```

2. **Create a Blob Container:**

   Create a blob container within the storage account to store the Terraform state file.

   ```bash
   az storage container create \
     --name tfstate \
     --account-name yourstorageaccountname
   ```

#### Step 3: Configure Terraform Backend

Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration and create a `main.tf` file:

```bash
mkdir my-terraform-project
cd my-terraform-project
touch main.tf
```

Edit the `main.tf` file to configure the Terraform backend with the storage account details:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    storage_account_name = "yourstorageaccountname"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Write Terraform Configuration

Add the following configuration to `main.tf` to create a Linux VM:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "main" {
  name                = "myVnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = "your-location"
  resource_group_name = "your-resource-group"

    offer     = "UbuntuServer"
    sku       = "18.04-LTS"
    version   = "latest"
  }

  os_profile {
    computer_name  = "hostname"
    admin_username = "azureuser"
    admin_password = "P@ssw0rd1234"
  }

  os_profile_linux_config {
    disable_password_authentication = false
  }
}
```

Replace `"your-location"`, `"your-resource-group"`, and `"yourstorageaccountname"` with your actual Azure location, resource group name, and storage account name.

#### Step 5: Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize Terraform. This will set up the backend and download the necessary provider plugins.

```bash
terraform init
```

#### Step 6: Plan and Apply the Configuration

1. **Plan the Configuration:**

   Run `terraform plan` to see the changes that will be made by this configuration.

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. **Apply the Configuration:**

   Run `terraform apply` to create the resources. You will be prompted to confirm the action.

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

#### Step 7: Verify the Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, you can verify the resources in the Azure portal under your resource group.

#### Step 8: Cleanup Resources

When you are done and want to remove the resources, you can use `terraform destroy`:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This command will remove all resources defined in the Terraform configuration.

### Summary

By following these steps, you have created a Linux virtual machine in Azure using Terraform and securely stored the Terraform state file in a storage account. This setup helps maintain the state of your infrastructure and ensures that your configurations are safely stored.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Got error: 
Error: Either an Access Key / SAS Token or the Resource Group for the Storage Account must be specified - or Azure AD Authentication must be enabled 

got above error in terraform init

=> 
The error message you received indicates that Terraform requires access credentials to interact with the Azure Storage Account where the Terraform state file is stored. There are a few ways to provide these credentials: using an Access Key, a SAS Token, or enabling Azure AD Authentication. Here’s how you can resolve this error by providing the necessary credentials.

### Option 1: Use Access Keys

You can provide the access keys directly in your Terraform configuration. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Retrieve the Access Key:**

   You can get the access key for your storage account via the Azure CLI or the Azure Portal.

   ```bash
   az storage account keys list --account-name yourstorageaccountname --resource-group your-resource-group
   ```

   Note down one of the keys from the output.

2. **Update `main.tf` to Use the Access Key:**

   Modify your `main.tf` file to include the access key for the backend configuration.

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "azurerm" {
       storage_account_name = "yourstorageaccountname"
       container_name       = "tfstate"
       key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
       access_key           = "your-access-key"
     }
   }
   ```

   Make sure to replace `"your-access-key"` with the actual access key obtained from the previous step.

### Option 2: Use a SAS Token

Alternatively, you can use a SAS Token to authenticate with the storage account.

1. **Generate a SAS Token:**

   Use the Azure CLI to generate a SAS Token for your storage account.

   ```bash
   az storage account generate-sas \
     --permissions acdlrw \
     --account-name yourstorageaccountname \
     --services b \
     --resource-types co \
     --expiry 2024-08-31T00:00:00Z \
     --output tsv
   ```

   This command generates a SAS Token valid until the specified expiry date. Make sure to adjust the expiry date as needed.

2. **Update `main.tf` to Use the SAS Token:**

   Modify your `main.tf` file to include the SAS Token for the backend configuration.

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "azurerm" {
       storage_account_name = "yourstorageaccountname"
       container_name       = "tfstate"
       key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
       sas_token            = "your-sas-token"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `"your-sas-token"` with the actual SAS Token obtained from the previous step.

### Option 3: Use Azure AD Authentication

To use Azure AD Authentication, you need to ensure that your Azure CLI is logged in with a user or service principal that has the necessary permissions to access the storage account.

1. **Ensure You Are Logged in via Azure CLI:**

   Make sure your Azure CLI session is authenticated.

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. **Assign the Required Role:**

   Assign a role to the user or service principal that allows access to the storage account, such as `Storage Blob Data Contributor`.

   ```bash
   az role assignment create --assignee your-azure-cli-user-or-service-principal \
     --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
     --scope /subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/yourstorageaccountname
   ```

### Initializing Terraform

After applying one of these solutions, run `terraform init` again:

```bash
terraform init
```

This should initialize the backend without errors, allowing you to manage your Terraform state securely in Azure.

-------------------------------------------

How to see tfstate file:

az storage blob list --account-name tfstatestorage240770 --container-name tfstate01 --output table
	This will list all the blobs in the container, including terraform.tfstate.

az storage blob download --account-name tfstatestorage240770 --container-name tfstate01 --name terraform.tfstate --file terraform.tfstate
	This command will download the terraform.tfstate file 
	


-------------------------------------------

4. **Define the YAML Pipeline:**

   Create a new file in your repository named `azure-pipelines.yml` and add the following content:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     - main  # Trigger pipeline on changes to the 'main' branch

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use an Ubuntu VM for the pipeline

   variables:
     ARM_CLIENT_ID: '<your-service-principal-client-id>'
     ARM_CLIENT_SECRET: '<your-service-principal-client-secret>'
     ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: '<your-subscription-id>'
     ARM_TENANT_ID: '<your-tenant-id>'
     ARM_ACCESS_KEY: '<your-storage-account-access-key>'  # Optional if using access key

   steps:
     - task: AzureCLI@2
       inputs:
         azureSubscription: '<your-service-connection-name>'
         scriptType: 'bash'
         scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
         inlineScript: |
           # Install Terraform
           curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
           sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
           sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform

           # Initialize Terraform
           terraform init

           # Plan Terraform deployment
           terraform plan -out=tfplan

           # Apply Terraform deployment
           terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan

   ```

   Replace the placeholders (e.g., `<your-service-principal-client-id>`, `<your-subscription-id>`, etc.) with your actual Azure credentials and configuration details.

5. **Create a Service Principal:**

   If you haven't already created a service principal for Azure authentication, run the following command in the Azure CLI to create one:

   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "your-sp-name" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/your-subscription-id
   ```

   Note the `appId`, `password`, `tenant`, and subscription ID from the output. These values correspond to `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARM_TENANT_ID`, and `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, respectively.

6. **Set Up a Service Connection:**

   In Azure DevOps, navigate to **Project settings** > **Service connections**. Create a new service connection for Azure Resource Manager using your service principal credentials.

Guide me step by step how can i implement azure key vault in Azure pipeline using Azure repo with simple text file 

To implement Azure Key Vault in an Azure DevOps pipeline and use it to manage secrets for a simple text file stored in an Azure repo, follow these detailed steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Key Vault**: Create an Azure Key Vault and store your secrets in it.
2. **Azure DevOps Project**: Have an Azure DevOps project with a repository where you will add the simple text file and the pipeline.

### Step 1: Set Up Azure Key Vault

1. **Create Azure Key Vault**:
   - Open the Azure Portal and navigate to Key Vaults.
   - Click on "Create" to create a new Key Vault.
   - Fill in the required information like resource group, Key Vault name, and region.

2. **Add a Secret to Azure Key Vault**:
   - Once the Key Vault is created, go to the **Secrets** section.
   - Click on **Generate/Import** to add a new secret.
   - Enter the name and value of the secret. For example, you could name it `mySecret` with the value `superSecretValue`.

3. **Assign Access Policies**:
   - Go to the **Access policies** section of your Key Vault.
   - Click on **Add Access Policy**.
   - Choose **Secret Management** template and select the `Get` and `List` permissions.
   - Assign access to the service principal used by your Azure DevOps pipeline.

### Step 2: Configure Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. **Create a Repository with a Simple Text File**:
   - Go to your Azure DevOps project.
   - Navigate to **Repos** and create a new repository or use an existing one.
   - Add a simple text file, e.g., `myFile.txt`, to the repository.

2. **Add a Secret to Use in Your Text File**:
   - Edit `myFile.txt` to include a placeholder for the secret, e.g.:
     ```
     The secret value is: {{SECRET_VALUE}}
     ```

3. **Create a Service Connection in Azure DevOps**:
   - Navigate to your project settings in Azure DevOps.
   - Go to **Service connections** and create a new connection for **Azure Resource Manager**.
   - Use the service principal option to authenticate and ensure it has access to the Key Vault.

4. **Install Azure Key Vault Task Extension**:
   - If not already installed, add the Azure Key Vault task extension from the Azure DevOps Marketplace.

5. **Create or Edit Your Pipeline YAML**:
   - In your Azure DevOps project, navigate to **Pipelines** and create a new pipeline.
   - Use the YAML editor and add the following configuration:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     - main  # or the branch you are using

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   variables:
     KEY_VAULT_NAME: '<YourKeyVaultName>'
     SECRET_NAME: 'mySecret'

   steps:
     - task: AzureKeyVault@2
       inputs:
         azureSubscription: '<YourAzureServiceConnection>'
         KeyVaultName: '$(KEY_VAULT_NAME)'
         SecretsFilter: '$(SECRET_NAME)'
         RunAsPreJob: false

     - script: |
         echo "Replacing secret in file"
         sed -i "s|{{SECRET_VALUE}}|$(mySecret)|g" myFile.txt
         cat myFile.txt
       displayName: 'Replace Secret in Text File'
   ```

   Replace `<YourKeyVaultName>` with your Key Vault's name and `<YourAzureServiceConnection>` with your Azure service connection name.

### Step 3: Run the Pipeline

- Commit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to the root of your repository.
- Go to the **Pipelines** section in Azure DevOps.
- Run the pipeline manually if it does not trigger automatically.
- The pipeline will fetch the secret from Azure Key Vault and replace the placeholder in `myFile.txt` with the secret value.

### Step 4: Verify the Output

- Check the pipeline logs to verify that the secret has been replaced in the file.
- The `sed` command output should show the contents of `myFile.txt` with the placeholder replaced by the actual secret value.

### Best Practices

- **Security**: Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to your Azure Key Vault and its secrets.
- **Auditing**: Enable logging in Azure Key Vault to track access and operations.
- **Secret Rotation**: Regularly update and rotate your secrets in Azure Key Vault.

By following these steps, you can securely integrate Azure Key Vault into your Azure DevOps pipeline to manage secrets for your applications.

i have created a terraform file which create a linux virtual machine using terraform in azure portal with storage container and storage blob so that we can save the tfstate file securely i am using already existing resource group and clone it into azure repo and Create a pipeline which will implement all ther terraform operations. Now i have to update resource in repo and check weather tfstate file is update or not.I only have main.tf file. Guide me step by step how can i do it.


To update a resource in your Terraform configuration, verify that the changes are reflected in the Azure infrastructure and ensure that the `tfstate` file is updated in the storage blob. Here are the steps you should follow:

### Step 1: Update Your `main.tf` File

1. **Modify the `main.tf` File:**
   - Update the necessary resources in your `main.tf` file. For example, you might want to change the virtual machine size, add a new tag, or modify network settings.

   Example modification (changing VM size):
   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "main" {
     name                  = "myVM"
     location              = "East US"
     resource_group_name   = data.azurerm_resource_group.existing.name
     network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.main.id]
     vm_size               = "Standard_B2s"  # Changed from "Standard_B1s" to "Standard_B2s"

     storage_os_disk {
       name              = "myOsDisk"
       caching           = "ReadWrite"
       create_option     = "FromImage"
       managed_disk_type = "Standard_LRS"
     }

     storage_image_reference {
       publisher = "Canonical"
       offer     = "UbuntuServer"
       sku       = "18.04-LTS"
       version   = "latest"
     }

     os_profile {
       computer_name  = "hostname"
       admin_username = "azureuser"
       admin_password = "P@ssw0rd1234"
     }

     os_profile_linux_config {
       disable_password_authentication = false
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Commit Changes to Azure Repos

1. **Stage and Commit Changes:**
   - Use Git to add and commit your changes to the `main.tf` file.
   ```bash
   git add main.tf
   git commit -m "Update VM size to Standard_B2s"
   ```

2. **Push Changes to Azure Repos:**
   - Push your changes to your Azure Repos repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Trigger the Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. **Ensure Your Pipeline is Configured:**
   - Make sure your Azure DevOps pipeline is configured to automatically run Terraform commands like `init`, `plan`, and `apply` on changes to the repository.

2. **Run the Pipeline:**
   - If your pipeline is not automatically triggered, manually start it in Azure DevOps.

3. **Pipeline Steps:**
   - **Terraform Init:** Initialize the Terraform configuration.
   - **Terraform Plan:** Generate and review an execution plan to ensure your changes are correct.
   - **Terraform Apply:** Apply the changes to the infrastructure.

   Your pipeline YAML should look something like this:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       include:
         - main

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   steps:
   - task: TerraformInstaller@0
     inputs:
       terraformVersion: 'latest'

   - task: Bash@3
     inputs:
       targetType: 'inline'
       script: |
         terraform init

   - task: Bash@3
     inputs:
       targetType: 'inline'
       script: |
         terraform plan -out=tfplan

   - task: Bash@3
     inputs:
       targetType: 'inline'
       script: |
         terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
   ```

### Step 4: Verify the `tfstate` File Update

1. **Check the Storage Blob:**
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal and check the storage container `tfstate01` to verify that the `terraform.tfstate` file has been updated.

2. **Verify Changes in Azure Portal:**
   - Confirm that the changes have been applied to your Azure resources. For example, check that the VM size has been updated to `Standard_B2s`.

### Step 5: Clean Up (if necessary)

1. **Remove any sensitive data:**
   - Ensure that any sensitive data (e.g., passwords or access keys) is stored securely, and not hard-coded into your Terraform files.

2. **Secure the Access Key:**
   - Consider using Azure Key Vault to securely manage and access the storage account access key.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Terraform configurations are updated and that the state file accurately reflects the current state of your infrastructure. If you encounter any issues during the process, feel free to ask for further assistance!
