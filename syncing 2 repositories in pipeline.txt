I am using azure devops.
I have 2 repositories EQMS and azure-pipelines.
in Azure pipelines i have my yaml file which is a primary pipeline file named as checkout.yml.
in EQMS i have another yaml file named as one.yml.
now my source code is present in EQMS repository.
but the libraries installation task is present in one.yml file which is present into another repository.
Now i have to sync both repository in pipeline so that it will install libraries.
Guide me step by step how can i do it


To achieve the synchronization between the two repositories (`EQMS` and `azure-pipelines`) in your Azure DevOps pipeline, you need to configure multiple repository checkouts in your `checkout.yml` file. Here is the step-by-step guide to do that:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Modify `checkout.yml` to Include Multiple Repositories**

   Update the `resources` section in your `checkout.yml` file to define both repositories (`EQMS` and `azure-pipelines`). Then, you need to ensure both repositories are checked out in your pipeline steps.

   ```yaml
   resources:
     repositories:
       - repository: EQMS
         type: git
         name: EQMS
         ref: refs/heads/${{ parameters.branch }}
       - repository: azure-pipelines
         type: git
         name: azure-pipelines
         ref: refs/heads/main  # Replace with the appropriate branch
   ```

2. **Checkout Multiple Repositories in Your Pipeline Steps**

   In the `steps` section of the `CheckoutAndList` job, you should update the checkout steps to include both repositories. Here is the modified `steps` section:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     - job: CheckoutAndList
       variables:
         - group: AppSettingsChanges-One
         - group: PublishPaths
         - name: BuildPlatform
           value: 'Any CPU'
         - name: BuildConfiguration
           value: 'Release'

       steps:
         - checkout: EQMS  # Checkout EQMS Repository
           displayName: 'Checkout EQMS Repository'

         - checkout: azure-pipelines  # Checkout azure-pipelines Repository
           displayName: 'Checkout Azure Pipelines Repository'

         - template: Template/one.yml@azure-pipelines  # Reference the template from azure-pipelines repository
   ```

3. **Reference `one.yml` from the `azure-pipelines` Repository**

   Update the reference to `one.yml` in the `steps` section to explicitly mention that the file is located in the `azure-pipelines` repository using `@azure-pipelines`:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - template: Template/one.yml@azure-pipelines
   ```

   This step tells the pipeline to use the `one.yml` file from the `azure-pipelines` repository.

4. **Ensure Correct Path to Your `one.yml` Template**

   Double-check that the path to the `one.yml` file is correct in the `azure-pipelines` repository. If the `one.yml` file is located in a different directory, update the path accordingly.

5. **Trigger the Pipeline**

   Now, when you trigger the pipeline, it will first checkout both repositories (`EQMS` and `azure-pipelines`). Then, it will reference the `one.yml` file from the `azure-pipelines` repository to run the steps required to install libraries and build the project.

### Final Version of `checkout.yml`

Here's the complete `checkout.yml` with the modifications:

```yaml
trigger:
  - none

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-2022'
  demands:
    - msbuild
    - visualstudio
    - vstest

parameters:
  - name: branch
    displayName: 'Branch Selection'
    type: string
    default: 'main'
    values:
      - main
      - one
      - two
      - three
      - four
      - five
      - six

resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: EQMS
      type: git
      name: EQMS 
      ref: refs/heads/${{ parameters.branch }}
    - repository: azure-pipelines
      type: git
      name: azure-pipelines
      ref: refs/heads/main  # Replace with the correct branch if needed

jobs:
  - job: CheckoutAndList
    variables:
      - group: AppSettingsChanges-One
      - group: PublishPaths
      - name: BuildPlatform
        value: 'Any CPU'
      - name: BuildConfiguration
        value: 'Release'

    steps:
      - checkout: EQMS
        displayName: 'Checkout EQMS Repository'

      - checkout: azure-pipelines
        displayName: 'Checkout Azure Pipelines Repository'

      - template: Template/one.yml@azure-pipelines
```

By following these steps, your pipeline will synchronize both repositories and execute the tasks defined in `one.yml`.
