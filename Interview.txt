Github Action:

Here are 20 interview questions and answers on GitHub Actions:

### 1. **What is GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your workflows directly in your GitHub repository. It helps in automating tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

### 2. **What are workflows in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** Workflows are custom automated processes that can be set up in a repository. They are defined by YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory. Workflows can have one or more jobs that execute on specified events.

### 3. **Explain the structure of a GitHub Actions workflow file.**
   **Answer:** A workflow file typically consists of:
   - `name`: Optional, the name of the workflow.
   - `on`: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow (e.g., push, pull_request).
   - `jobs`: A map of jobs to execute. Each job contains:
     - `runs-on`: Specifies the environment for the job (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
     - `steps`: List of steps, including actions and scripts to run.

### 4. **What is a job in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs run in parallel by default, but they can be configured to run sequentially using the `needs` keyword.

### 5. **What are runners in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** Runners are servers that run your workflows when they are triggered. GitHub provides both hosted runners (virtual machines provided by GitHub) and self-hosted runners (user-provided machines).

### 6. **How can you trigger a workflow manually?**
   **Answer:** You can trigger a workflow manually using the `workflow_dispatch` event in the `on` field of your workflow file. It allows you to provide input parameters when manually triggering a workflow.

### 7. **What are GitHub Action secrets and how are they used?**
   **Answer:** Secrets are encrypted environment variables that are created at the repository or organization level. They are used to store sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and passwords securely. They can be accessed in workflows using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`.

### 8. **How can you reuse workflows in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** Reusable workflows can be created by defining them in a separate repository or within the same repository and calling them using the `uses` keyword. They must be defined with the `workflow_call` trigger to be reusable.

### 9. **How do you define environment variables in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** Environment variables can be defined at different levels:
   - Workflow level: Using the `env` key at the top level of the workflow.
   - Job level: Using the `env` key under a specific job.
   - Step level: Using the `env` key within a step.

### 10. **What is the purpose of the `matrix` strategy in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** The `matrix` strategy is used to run a job multiple times with different configurations. It allows you to define a set of parameters (e.g., different versions of Node.js or Python) and execute the job for each combination.

### 11. **How can you conditionally run a job or step in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** You can use the `if` keyword to conditionally run jobs or steps based on expressions. For example: `if: ${{ success() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}`.

### 12. **What are composite actions in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** Composite actions allow you to create a reusable set of steps that can be included in multiple workflows. They are defined in a `.yml` file under the `.github/actions` directory of a repository.

### 13. **How can you debug a GitHub Actions workflow?**
   **Answer:** You can debug a workflow by enabling `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` and `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secrets to get verbose logs. Additionally, you can use `::debug`, `::warning`, and `::error` commands to print custom messages in logs.

### 14. **What is an `artifact` in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** An artifact is a file or set of files generated during a workflow run that can be shared and downloaded. They are often used to store build outputs, test results, and other intermediate files.

### 15. **How can you use caching in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** GitHub Actions provides a `cache` action that allows you to cache dependencies and other commonly used files to speed up subsequent workflow runs. You can specify a cache key and path to cache.

### 16. **How can you prevent a workflow from running for certain conditions?**
   **Answer:** You can prevent a workflow from running using the `if` condition in jobs or steps, or by specifying conditions in the `on` field, such as `branches-ignore` and `paths-ignore`.

### 17. **What is a `checkout` action in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** The `checkout` action is used to check out the source code of your repository into the runner environment. It is typically the first step in a workflow to access the repository code.

### 18. **How can you handle secrets in GitHub Actions for self-hosted runners?**
   **Answer:** For self-hosted runners, secrets are still stored securely in GitHub and are injected into the environment variables. It's important to ensure that the self-hosted runner is secure and that no unauthorized access can occur.

### 19. **What is the purpose of the `continue-on-error` attribute in GitHub Actions?**
   **Answer:** The `continue-on-error` attribute allows a step to be marked as successful even if it fails. This is useful for steps where failure is acceptable or for testing purposes.

### 20. **How can you use third-party actions in GitHub Actions workflows?**
   **Answer:** Third-party actions can be used by referencing them in the `uses` key in a workflow step, specifying the repository and the version (e.g., `actions/checkout@v3`). They provide reusable functionality such as setup tools, notifications, etc.

These questions and answers should give you a comprehensive understanding of GitHub Actions and help you prepare for interviews related to it.

GIT ?

Here is a list of common Git merging strategies:

### **1. Fast-Forward Merge:**
- **Description:** This strategy moves the branch pointer forward to the tip of the merged branch if there are no divergent commits. It does not create a new merge commit.
- **Use Case:** Used when the branch has not diverged from the main branch, resulting in a linear commit history.
- **Command:** `git merge --ff` (fast-forward by default)

### **2. Recursive Merge:**
- **Description:** The default strategy for merging two branches that have diverged. It performs a three-way merge between the two branch tips and their common ancestor, creating a new merge commit.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for most merging situations where branches have diverged.
- **Command:** `git merge` (default strategy)

### **3. Merge Commit (No Fast-Forward):**
- **Description:** Creates a new merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, preserving the commit history of both branches.
- **Use Case:** Useful for maintaining a detailed history of branch merges, such as for feature development or hotfixes.
- **Command:** `git merge --no-ff`

### **4. Squash Merge:**
- **Description:** Combines all changes from a branch into a single commit before merging into the target branch. It "squashes" multiple commits into one.
- **Use Case:** Used to keep the main branch history clean by summarizing all changes from a feature or topic branch into a single commit.
- **Command:** `git merge --squash`

### **5. Rebase:**
- **Description:** Moves or "replays" commits from one branch onto another, resulting in a linear commit history. It avoids creating a merge commit.
- **Use Case:** Useful for keeping a clean and linear project history by integrating changes without creating unnecessary merge commits.
- **Command:** `git rebase`

### **6. Ours Merge Strategy:**
- **Description:** Keeps all the changes from the current branch and ignores the changes from the merged-in branch. A new commit is created, but the changes from the merged branch are discarded.
- **Use Case:** Used when the current branch's changes should take precedence over another branch’s changes.
- **Command:** `git merge -s ours`

### **7. Theirs Merge Strategy:**
- **Description:** Opposite of "ours"; it keeps all the changes from the merged-in branch and discards the changes from the current branch.
- **Use Case:** Used when the incoming branch's changes should take precedence.
- **Command:** (There is no direct `git merge -s theirs` command, but similar behavior can be achieved through rebasing or resolving conflicts manually.)

### **8. Octopus Merge Strategy:**
- **Description:** A multi-branch merge strategy used to merge more than two branches at the same time.
- **Use Case:** Useful for merging multiple feature branches or topic branches simultaneously. It can only handle non-conflicting merges.
- **Command:** `git merge -s octopus`

### **9. Ours (Recursive) Strategy:**
- **Description:** A variant of the recursive merge strategy that favors the current branch in the event of conflicts.
- **Use Case:** Useful for merging branches where you want to keep your branch's version of every conflicting change.
- **Command:** `git merge -X ours`

### **10. Subtree Merge Strategy:**
- **Description:** Merges a branch that is a subdirectory of another project, treating it as a subtree.
- **Use Case:** Used when combining multiple repositories or integrating external code into a subdirectory of the current repository.
- **Command:** `git merge -s subtree`

Would you like a deeper explanation or examples of how to use any of these strategies?

Workflow of basic pipeline in GitHub ActionsL:

Explaining a basic GitHub Actions pipeline to an interviewer involves breaking down the core concepts and components in a clear and structured manner. Here’s a simple way to explain it:

---

**1. Introduction to GitHub Actions:**

"GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform that allows you to automate workflows for your GitHub repository. You can use it to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repository."

---

**2. Components of a GitHub Actions Pipeline:**

**- Workflow:**
"A workflow is a customizable automated process that runs on specific events, such as a push to a branch or a pull request. It is defined in a YAML file located in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository."

**- Jobs:**
"A workflow consists of one or more jobs. Jobs are units of work that run on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners. Each job runs in its own virtual environment, and you can configure jobs to run sequentially or in parallel."

**- Steps:**
"Each job is made up of steps. Steps are individual tasks or commands that run in sequence within a job. Steps can run shell commands, use pre-built actions, or call custom scripts."

**- Actions:**
"Actions are reusable pieces of code that perform specific tasks, such as setting up a development environment, installing dependencies, or deploying code. Actions can be public and shared from the GitHub Marketplace or custom actions created for your specific needs."

---

**3. Example of a Basic Pipeline:**

"Let's walk through an example of a basic pipeline. Suppose we want to set up a simple workflow that runs tests every time code is pushed to the repository."

**- Workflow YAML File:**
"This is how the `.github/workflows/test.yml` file might look:"

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '14'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

**- Breakdown of the YAML File:**
  - `name`: Specifies the name of the workflow. In this case, it's "CI" (Continuous Integration).
  - `on`: Defines the event that triggers the workflow. Here, it triggers on a push to the `main` branch.
  - `jobs`: Contains the list of jobs that the workflow will run.
  - `test`: The job name. Each job runs on a specified runner. In this case, it uses `ubuntu-latest`.
  - `steps`: The list of steps that the job will execute.
    - `actions/checkout@v3`: Checks out the code from the repository.
    - `actions/setup-node@v3`: Sets up Node.js environment with version 14.
    - `npm install`: Installs project dependencies.
    - `npm test`: Runs the test suite.

---

**4. Benefits of GitHub Actions:**

"Using GitHub Actions provides several benefits:
- **Integrated Environment**: Directly integrated with GitHub repositories.
- **Flexibility**: Customizable workflows that can handle various stages of development.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual work by automating repetitive tasks like testing and deployment."

---

By following this structure, you’ll provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of a basic GitHub Actions pipeline.

   A repository (repo) in Git is a storage location where the project's files and their version history are stored. It can be local (on a developer's computer) or remote (on platforms like GitHub or GitLab).

4. **How do you create a new repository in Git?**  
   **Answer:**  
   To create a new Git repository, use the command `git init` inside the project directory. This command initializes a new local repository.

5. **What is a commit in Git?**  
   **Answer:**  
   A commit is a snapshot of the changes in the repository. It records changes to the files and creates a unique ID (hash) for each commit. Commits help in tracking the history of changes in the project.

6. **How do you create a new branch in Git?**  
   **Answer:**  
   To create a new branch, use the command `git branch branch-name`. This creates a branch from the current HEAD. To switch to the new branch, use `git checkout branch-name` or `git switch branch-name`.

7. **What is the purpose of the `git merge` command?**  
   **Answer:**  
   The `git merge` command is used to combine changes from different branches into a single branch. It integrates the changes from a specified branch into the current branch.

8. **How do you check the status of your Git repository?**  
   **Answer:**  
   To check the status of a Git repository, use the command `git status`. This shows the current state of the repository, including modified, added, or deleted files.

9. **What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**  
   **Answer:**  
   `git fetch` downloads changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into the local branch, while `git pull` downloads changes and immediately merges them into the current branch.

10. **How do you revert a commit in Git?**  
   **Answer:**  
   To revert a commit, use the command `git revert commit-hash`. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit.

13. **How do you delete a branch in Git?**  
    **Answer:**  
    To delete a local branch, use `git branch -d branch-name`. To delete a remote branch, use `git push origin --delete branch-name`.

14. **What is a detached HEAD in Git?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A detached HEAD occurs when you are not on any branch but directly on a commit. Changes made in this state are not saved to any branch and could be lost unless explicitly committed to a branch.

15. **How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Merge conflicts occur when multiple changes conflict. To resolve them, open the conflicting file, decide which changes to keep, and manually edit the file. After resolving, use `git add` to stage the changes and `git commit` to complete the merge.

16. **What does the `git reset` command do?**  
    **Answer:**  
    `git reset` is used to undo changes by moving the HEAD and current branch to a specific commit. It has three modes: `--soft` (keeps changes in the staging area), `--mixed` (keeps changes in the working directory), and `--hard` (removes all changes).

17. **What is the `.gitignore` file, and how is it used?**  
    **Answer:**  
    The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that Git should ignore. It is used to prevent unnecessary files (like temporary files, build artifacts) from being tracked in the repository.

18. **How do you clone a Git repository?**  
    **Answer:**  
    To clone a repository, use `git clone repository-url`. This command creates a local copy of the remote repository on your machine.

    **Answer:**  
    `git stash` temporarily saves changes that are not ready to commit. To save changes, use `git stash`, and to reapply them later, use `git stash apply`.

20. **What is the purpose of the `git cherry-pick` command?**  
    **Answer:**  
    `git cherry-pick` applies a specific commit from one branch to another. It is useful for applying bug fixes or specific changes without merging the entire branch.

### Advanced Git Questions:

21. **What is `git bisect`, and how does it work?**  
    **Answer:**  
    `git bisect` is used to find a commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search. You mark one commit as good and another as bad, and Git identifies the problematic commit.

22. **How can you see a list of all branches in a repository?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Use `git branch` to see all local branches and `git branch -r` for remote branches. Use `git branch -a` to list both local and remote branches.

23. **What is a submodule in Git?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A submodule is a repository inside another repository. It allows you to include external repositories in your project while maintaining their own separate histories.

24. **How do you squash commits in Git?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Use `git rebase -i HEAD~n` (where `n` is the number of commits to squash). This opens an interactive editor where you can combine multiple commits into one.

25. **What is `git reflog`, and why is it useful?**  
    **Answer:**  
    `git reflog` records changes to the HEAD, allowing you to recover lost commits or branches. It’s useful for undoing accidental resets or deletions.

26. **How do you rename a branch in Git?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Use `git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name` to rename a branch locally. For remote branches, delete the old branch and push the renamed one.

27. **What is `git tag`, and how is it used?**  
    **Answer:**  
    `git tag` is used to mark specific points in history, usually for releases. Tags can be lightweight or annotated (including additional information like a message and tagger details).

28. **How do you force push changes to a remote repository?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Use `git push --force` to overwrite the remote branch with your local changes. Use this carefully as it can overwrite others’ work.

29. **What is the purpose of the `git remote` command?**  
    **Answer:**  
    `git remote` manages remote repository connections. Use `git remote -v` to list all remotes, `git remote add` to add a new remote, or `git remote remove` to delete a remote.

30. **How do you undo the last commit but keep the changes?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the last commit but keep the changes in the staging area. Use `git reset HEAD~1` to keep changes in the working directory.
