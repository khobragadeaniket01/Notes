Git Notes:

1. Basic Concepts
   - Version control systems
		A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps track and manage changes to files over time
		
   - Distributed vs. centralized VCS
	 Centralize:
		Single central repository
		Users check out and commit to central server
		Requires network connection for most operations
		Examples: Subversion (SVN), Perforce
	 Distributed:
		Each user has a full copy of the repository
		Users can work offline and synchronize later
		Multiple backup copies of the project exist
		Examples: Git, Mercurial
